Analysis scripts for new Arepo simulations exploring variations in MBH particle implementations

- Copied over Paul Torrey's plotting scripts from `/n/home01/ptorrey/Runs/ISM_Boxes/analysis`, and required modules from `/n/home01/ptorrey/Python/vogelsbergerlabtools/Python`
  - Made a copy '_paul_analysis' for unmodified versions
